            Jo actual reason aapne bataya wo itna sa reason ho hi nhi sakta, mummy ne jo bola wo bas ek bahana tha. In fact you never loved me it was just attraction, attachment or maybe lust? Pyar itna sasta hota hai jo 1 month mein hi khatam hojayega? Aapko ye 1 month mein mtlb 26 Apr ya something ko realise hua and that's when you started talking less tabhi se ye ignore game shuru hua tbhi se interest khatam hogya tha and yes ab na bolo ki tum koi webseries thodi ho 🤡(I got the closure ,feels like one shot hi thi mai) kyuki ye sab bas aapka timepass hi tha I don't know tum ladke aise kyu hote ho samjh kyu nhi ata hamare pass bhi dil hai 🙁 Jab bhi maine pucha aapko "kahi aap timepass to nhi kr rhe na mere sath" Aap kehte the gharwalo ne isliye thodi bada kiya hai but apne kya kiya whi na? Ab kya hua?? And please don't ever say that you actually loved me, no ye pyar ho hi nhi sakta jisme aap usse marte hue, itne dard mein rehte dekh sakte ho sehen kr sakte ho to no,  you never loved me not even a single second kyuki in my case mai kabhi apko itna suffer krte dekh bhi nhi sakti but you literally destroyed me by your ignorance, made fun of my real feelings, took me for granted. I don't know wo first ily bola tha it was for real? I don't know why boys love to Awaken the women's love and leave them half way? 🙂I mean literally whyy? Bhai kisise to daro atleast bhagwan se to? Karma will never forgive you man🙂.
            Ye khelne ki chiz hai? Dil? 

            Ek example deti hu agar, offend mat hona, agar aapki behen ko koi aise ladka mil jaye jo usse bohot achhe se baat krta ho usko saari apni attention deta ho usko har baar pyar ka zikr krta ho, and ab aapki behen puri uske pyar mein dub chuki hai thinking that he's a purest green forest he's never gonna leave her. And next day he comes to her saying that we don't have any future together, ok, she even agreed there but her heart don't want to let him go cause she actually fucking love him. She's trying everything to convince him forgetting her mental, physical health just to make him stay so that they can find a way for it cause nothing is impossible in this world nothing. But still he started to ignore her cause he obviously lost all the interest in her.....reason god knows....maybe he never loved her or he just played her? Wo jabtak try krti hai jabtak uski puri self respect ki dhajiya na udaye and wo usko puri tarah se dil se khali na krde tabtak? 
            Just think kaisa lagega aapko? Well agar kbhi loyalty respect pata hogi to hi ye sab soch paoge. 
            Ab ye bhi na bolo ki maine kabhi kisi ladki ko disrespect krte hue dekha hai? Kisi ladki ko gaali na dena unse achhe se baat krna wo to har koi krta hai but kisi ladki ko day 1 se fake hopes dena and usko pehle apne pyar mein dubana and fir koi ek faltu bahana batake ye kehna ki aapna future nahi hai and then usko itni buri tareeke se zaleel krna, ignore krna, uske pyar ka ek tarah se mazak hi udana , isko kehte hai disrespect in actual. Ye sab pure heart hoga to aapki himmat bhi nhi ho sakti aisa kuch krna neverrr... But Mai chutiya apna future aise insaan ke sath dekhliya jo mujhe game mein mila wo bhi gamer? I mean usko laga ki mera dil bhi ek game hai khel gya? Maybe socha chlo koi nhi ek baar krke dekhta hu? 
            Itna sab hone ke baad mai hi paglo jaise sorry bolti thi wo bhi just to hear that, nhi tumhari koi galti nhi galti meri hi thi but nhi reply mein to bas "koi nhi, no problem" itna hi ata tha jabki meri 1% bhi galti nhi i was there with pure heart which still loves you❤️. I used to think mai hi pareshan kr rhi hu aapko but thanks to god usne mujhe dil todne walo mein se nhi to tutne walo mein banaya hai... Atleast kbhi kisika dil nhi toda and jisse bhi dil lagaya bas ussi ko chaha kbhi kisi ko fake hopes nhi diye and end tak fight kri uske liye and I'm grateful for that fs 🙂.
